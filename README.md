# CS Mania

This is Adrian and Brendan's ICS3U final project.
We implemented a mania-style VSRG.

## Build Instructions

Simply build the source under `src/`.
There are no dependencies to manage.
Copy `songs/`, `hitsounds/`, and `mainmenubg.png` to the same
working directory as the jar file.

## Run Instructions

If you have a `dist/` folder, simply enter that folder
and run `CSMania.jar`.

## Known Bugs
- Slight audio overlap in song select
